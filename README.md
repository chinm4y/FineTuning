Fine-Tuning Transformer Models for Text Classification
This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of a pre-trained transformer model using the Hugging Face ecosystem for a text classification task. It provides a complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation, designed to showcase the capabilities of transfer learning in natural language processing.

Key Components:
